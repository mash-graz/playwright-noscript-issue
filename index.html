        <h1>Demonstration of a <code>noscript</code> issue</h1>

        <p>Here you should see a visual reminder, if JS was dissabled
        durring this Test:</p>

        <noscript><b id="id1">JS Disabled (1)</b></noscript>

        <p>(Unfortunatly you will never <b>see</b> the message 
            in playwrigths ui-viewer because of a bug!)</p>

        <p>Just to check, if NoScript emulation works at all
        in playwright, we generate here the correct output 
        by other means:</p>

        <b id="id2">JS Disabled (2)</b>
        <script>document.getElementById("id2").hidden = true;</script>
    </body>
